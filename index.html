      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      KIA cars recently launched a new logo in 2021, and while the new design is the word "KIA," it resembles the letters "K" and "N." This has caused confusion among some customers, who have searched online for a "KN" car.

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      To clarify, the new KIA logo is not actually the letters "K" and "N," but rather a stylized design that resembles those letters. The new design is modern, bold, and represents the company's commitment to innovation and growth. The new logo can be seen on KIA's website, as well as on their vehicles and marketing materials.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      It is understandable that the change may be confusing to some customers, but it is important to note that KIA is still the same brand it has always been. The company is known for its sleek, stylish vehicles and its commitment to providing high-quality, reliable transportation options. The new logo reflects this brand identity and signals to customers that the company is dedicated to staying at the forefront of the automotive industry.
